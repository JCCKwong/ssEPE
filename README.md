This application predicts the risk of side-specific extraprostatic extension (ssEPE) using clinicopathological features
known prior to radical prostatectomy. The proposed use is for clinicians to input de-identified patient features and the
model will output a probability of ssEPE for the left and right lobe. This can be used in the context of patient
counselling and/or for tailoring surgical strategy (ie: nerve-sparing).

This model was developed in accordance to the STREAM-URO framework
